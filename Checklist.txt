Checklist for Deploying an Interactive HTML/JS Music Player on OBJKT
Responsive Layout and Mobile Browser Quirks
Use Responsive Design Practices: Include a responsive meta viewport tag (e.g. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">) to ensure the layout adapts to various screen sizes. Design your CSS with flexible layouts or media queries so the player UI looks correct on both desktop and mobile screens.
Test on Mobile Devices: Verify that all interface elements (buttons, sliders, etc.) display and function properly on common mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome). Check for any overflow, scaling issues, or text that is too small. Adjust styling (via CSS breakpoints or fluid sizing) so that controls remain legible and reachable on smaller touch screens.
Touch Interaction Support: Ensure that all interactive features work with touch input. Avoid relying on hover-only effects or desktop-specific events. Use pointer or touch events for interactions like tapping buttons or dragging sliders, or use the Pointer Events API to handle both mouse and touch seamlessly. This guarantees the music player is fully usable via touch (e.g. volume sliders and play/pause work with a tap or swipe).
Mobile Safari/Autoplay Constraints: Plan for the mobile browser audio policies. Most mobile browsers (and desktop browsers with autoplay policies) will not play audio until the user performs an interaction​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
. Implement a play/start button or user gesture to initiate audio playback. For example, you might display a “Tap to Start” overlay that the user must tap to begin the music, which then triggers the audio context or <audio> element. This ensures the music will play as intended, since autoplaying audio without interaction (or without being muted) is typically blocked by browsers​

. Test that after a user tap, the audio starts on both desktop and mobile.
File Bundling and Relative Paths (Self-Contained Assets)
Embed All Assets Locally: Package all resources your project needs within the project folder so the experience is fully self-contained. Include all HTML, JavaScript, CSS, images, audio files, fonts, and any libraries. Do not reference any CDN or external URLs for scripts, fonts, or data – external requests will be blocked on OBJKT​
DOCS.OBJKT.COM
. For example, if you use a library like p5.js or Tone.js, download the library file and include it in your ZIP rather than linking to a CDN​
DOCS.OBJKT.COM
. Likewise, host custom fonts by adding the font files (WOFF/TTF) to the project and use @font-face in your CSS.
Use Relative Paths Everywhere: Ensure that all your internal links and asset references are relative paths. For instance, use src="./images/background.png" or href="styles/main.css" instead of absolute paths or domain-based URLs​
DOCS.OBJKT.COM
. Double-check that no references start with http://, https:// or a leading / – they should all point to files within the ZIP package. This applies to script and link tags in HTML, CSS url() references, audio/video src attributes, and any AJAX/fetch calls (which should fetch local files or be removed entirely).
Maintain a Clean Folder Structure: Organize the project files in a single folder hierarchy. The main HTML file must be named index.html and reside at the root of the ZIP (not inside a subfolder)​
GITHUB.COM
. You can use subfolders for organizing assets (e.g. css/, js/, assets/), just ensure your code points to them correctly (e.g. src="js/lib.js"). Before zipping, test that opening index.html from the folder loads all resources correctly without any server – this simulates how OBJKT will load it.
Include a Cover Image: Choose a representative image from your project to serve as the cover/thumbnail for the NFT. Add that image file to your project folder (JPEG, PNG or GIF formats are allowed) and reference it in the HTML <head> using an Open Graph meta tag. For example: <meta property="og:image" content="path/to/your/cover.jpg" />​
GITHUB.COM
. This ensures OBJKT picks up the cover image for the gallery thumbnail. Make sure the cover image is a reasonable size (the platform suggests keeping it under ~2 MB​
DOCS.OBJKT.COM
, e.g. a 1200×630 px image works well) to meet OBJKT’s preview requirements.
JS and CSS Best Practices for Embedded ZIP Builds
Minify and Optimize Code: Use minified versions of your JS and CSS files to reduce file size and improve load performance. Remove whitespace, comments, and unused code. If you have a build system or bundler, generate a production build – this often minifies assets and strips out development-only code. Smaller files will help your ZIP load faster, even though 55 MB is within the limit, it's good practice to minimize assets for user experience.
Remove Debug and Dev Elements: Strip out any debugging overlays, logs, or development UI before final build. For example, if you added an FPS counter, boundary outlines, or console console.log() statements for testing, remove them for production. These can clutter the experience or slow it down. Ensure that any test buttons or key bindings used during development (e.g. a keyboard shortcut to skip tracks used for debugging) are disabled or removed in the released version.
Use Production Libraries: If your project relies on third-party libraries or frameworks, include the production-optimized versions. For instance, use the minified .min.js files for libraries (like p5.min.js, three.min.js, etc.) instead of the unminified versions. This not only reduces size but also avoids source maps or warnings that dev builds might include. Similarly, ensure any CSS frameworks are the minified builds.
Ensure Cross-Browser Compatibility: Check that your CSS and JS work across different browsers/environments. Since the NFT will run in an isolated iframe on various devices, make sure to account for vendor prefixes or fallbacks for any cutting-edge CSS features. Use CSS resets or prefixes as needed (e.g. -webkit- for certain mobile Safari CSS features) to ensure consistent styling. Also verify that any ES6+ JavaScript features you use are supported by target browsers, or include appropriate polyfills (added to your bundle) if necessary.
No External Dependencies or Calls: As a final sanity check, scan your code for any external API calls or references that might have slipped in. The sandboxed environment will block most external network requests​
DOCS.OBJKT.COM
, so if your music player tries to fetch data from an API or load assets from an external URL, it could fail. Remove or replace such functionality with self-contained logic or offline data. (If your project must fetch external data, ensure it’s from an OBJKT-allowed domain or consider embedding the data within the project.)
Performance on Mobile: Optimize for performance, especially on mobile devices. Large audio or graphics can be taxing, so consider using efficient file formats (e.g. a compressed MP3 for audio, optimized images) and manage memory usage. If your player has animations or visualizers, use requestAnimationFrame for JS animations and CSS transitions where possible for smoother performance. Test that the music playback and any visualization run without significant lag on a typical smartphone.
Deployment Steps for OBJKT (Interactive HTML ZIP)
Finalize Project and Verify Offline: Ensure your project folder is finalized for production. Do one last test by opening index.html in a browser (or a simple local server) to verify that everything works with no external connectivity. Check the console for errors (there should be none, since all files are local and paths correct). Verify the audio loads and can be played via a user gesture, and the layout looks good on both desktop and mobile dimensions.
Compress into a ZIP: Zip the contents of your project folder. The ZIP should contain index.html at the root, plus all subfolders/files. The total file size must be under 250 MB (OBJKT’s limit for interactive tokens​
DOCS.OBJKT.COM
). Your build is ~55 MB which is fine, but double-check you didn’t accidentally include any unnecessary large files. (If you have any source PSDs or unused assets in the folder, remove them before zipping.) The smaller the ZIP, the quicker collectors can load the piece.
Prepare the Cover Image: Ensure you have the cover image ready. If OBJKT’s minting interface asks for a separate cover upload, be ready to provide that image (the same one referenced in your meta tag). If the platform automatically picks up the cover from the meta tag, then you’re all set. Just verify that the image meets the format and size requirements (JPEG/PNG/GIF, under 2 MB​
DOCS.OBJKT.COM
).
Mint on OBJKT.com: Go to objkt.com and initiate the process to mint a new token (navigate to your profile and click “Create” or “Mint”). Choose the interactive/HTML token option if prompted. Fill in the token details (title, description, tags, etc.) as required.
Upload ZIP and Cover: When prompted to upload your artwork, select the ZIP file of your interactive music player. Also upload the cover image if the interface requires a separate one (in some cases the platform might use the og:image from your HTML, but if not, you’ll need to provide it manually). The platform will upload your files (often to IPFS in the background) – wait for it to finish.
Preview and Test on OBJKT: After uploading, OBJKT will display a preview of the interactive token in a sandboxed iframe on the minting page. Thoroughly test the preview before minting. Check that the visuals appear correctly and that you can start the music playback. Remember that audio may not autoplay on load – click the interface to ensure the sound starts. Confirm that there are no debug elements visible and that the experience matches what you expect on both desktop and mobile (you can scan the QR code or share the preview link to test on your phone).
Mint the NFT: Once the preview looks good and you’re satisfied everything is working (and all checklist items have been addressed), proceed with minting. Ensure your crypto wallet is connected and funded for the gas/fees. Finalize the minting on OBJKT. After minting, view the live token page to double-check the interactive music player runs as intended for end users.
Post-Mint Considerations: After deployment, double-check the token’s public page. Verify the cover thumbnail shows up in galleries and that the interactive player launches and functions. Keep in mind the content is running in a sandboxed iframe on OBJKT – by default it has script and download permissions only​

. (If your project ever needs more advanced features like storing data or if you encounter same-origin policy issues, instruct viewers to use OBJKT’s “Advanced Mode”, which allows allow-same-origin​

. However, for a music player that is self-contained, this shouldn’t be necessary.) Monitor for any user feedback or issues (for example, if some mobile device has a quirk) and be prepared to update and remint if a critical fix is needed.
By following this checklist, you will ensure your interactive HTML/JS music player NFT is optimized, fully self-contained, and compliant with OBJKT’s platform requirements. Each step helps guarantee that collectors on both desktop and mobile get a smooth, consistent experience. Good luck with your deployment!
